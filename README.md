# Repeated-DNA-Sequences
Challenge at LeetCode.com. Tags: Rolling Hash, String, Sliding Window.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem can be solved just with hash tables of strings, in  fewer lines of code, and due to the small size of the input, 
it would be as fast as a more efficient solution, such as rolling hash. However, the purpose here is to demonstrate rolling hash.
